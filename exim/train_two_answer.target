a forest of white coral .
diamonds .
she stroked his back many times .
he was only born yesterday .
yesterday .
in a velvet - covered chair , up at the master 's house .
the housekeeper 's room .
he kicked away the bone i was gnawing .
the flames darted out of its mouth .
stove sick .
the snow man decreased .
a stove scraper .
the girls in the house .
move away from that place .
a young girl and a young man .
the yard - dog had been there longer than the snow man .
the stove .
he had to .
the black people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country .
looked about for a nice , cool spot .
it was very hard to light it again .
rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame .
the wood was too wet .
guddhu the cod .
stripped some pieces of bark off a tree , and placed them on top of the smouldering ashes .
a blast of wind swept down from the hills and blew the fire out towards them .
the fire , driven by the strong wind had followed them right down to the bottom of the pool .
found the flames as hot as before , and that fire never went out , like those upon land , but kept burning for ever .
there was a fire on the land .
the rain will put out the fire .
it was very cold .
a fish offered to help them .
they did n't want the wind to put out the fire .
it was cold under the water .
a mischievous kind of spirit .
he could change himself into a man , woman or child , a stick , a goat , a ploughshare .
a needle .
puck .
unfastened the chains that fixed each beast in its own stall , and let them fall with a heavy clang to the ground .
a sheep who was bleating loudly .
william thought it must have strayed from the flock .
ran towards home as fast as his legs would carry him .
a voice spoke out from over his head .
a fly .
he grew tired of cowboys and shepherds .
the different coloured reels of cotton .
the dressmaker was coming in to - morrow .
it matched the stuffs so perfectly , and never tied itself in knots , or broke perpetually , as most thread did .
the young people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood , and their parents were very rich .
the wedding garments fell to the ground , to the great confusion of the wearer .
to examine the dress , determined , if she could , to find out the cause of the disaster .
the thread had vanished .
startled .
upset .
puck wanted to play another trick .
puck .
happy .
amazed .
her dress fell apart .
the kilin .
confucius .
he did much good on earth .
the homeland of confucius .
wished to have it opened and see what was in it .
emperor tsin schi huang .
alarmed .
he fell ill of a hasty fever of which he died .
schakiu .
the emperor , in jest , put on the shoes , took the staff and left the grave .
advised him not to do so .
seated himself on the bed and looked down .
sought the child and spat out a jade .
he had a tablet that predicted emperor tsin schi huang 's actions .
he will steal from confucius 's grave .
to make a bridge .
the giant 's causeway .
he made a walking - stick of it and set out on his way to oonagh .
on knockmany hill .
oonagh .
no other giant could stand before him .
kept dodging about from place to place .
to have a trial of strength with finn .
lonely .
to show oonagh how much he was delighted that she made herself happy in his absence .
a thunderbolt .
clapped his thumb in his mouth .
dungannon .
far rua .
he knew that oonagh was hand - and - glove with the fairies .
granua .
on the very top of cullamore .
held many agreeable conversation across the valley .
picking bilberries at althadhawn .
the biggest giant that ever was known coming up from dungannon .
to give oonagh and finn time to think of some plan to get themselves out of the scrape .
fifteen or sixteen tubs , or the largest miscaun .
the miscaun fell about half - way between the two hills at the edge of the broad bog , near augher .
say the charm that was to send it up .
a grey stone .
she will give finn a cast of heather broth , or a panada of oak bark .
melancholy .
drew the nine woollen threads of different colors .
kneaded into the hearts of one - and - twenty cakes of bread .
oonagh sent round to the neighbors and borrowed one - and - twenty iron griddles .
he will be no more than a common man .
lie down in the cradle and cover himself up with the clothes .
finn m'coul .
he set out there to try if he could catch far rua .
went outside , and getting his arms about the house , completely turned it as oonagh had wished .
stooped down , tore a cleft about four hundred feet deep and a quarter of a mile in length .
her woman 's wit .
he left the place in such a fury that he never thought of it .
if she did n't do it , finn would not be pleased with her .
stunned .
two of far rua 's teeth were out .
finn .
gave a skirl .
a cake that had no griddle in it .
he 'd have no chance with a man who could eat such bread as that , which even his son that 's in the cradle can munch before his eyes .
he got black in the face with the efforts .
finn took the stone , slyly exchanged it for the curds , and squeezed until the whey oozed out .
he never wished to hear of , much less to see , her husband .
delight .
far rua was about to take his departure without discovering the tricks that been played off on him .
what kind of teeth could eat griddle - cakes like that .
surprised .
far rua gave one loud groan and fell down at once with terror and weakness .
he now knew that his most powerful and bitterest enemy was completely at his mercy .
he wanted to give finn a considerable beating .
he did not want to be beaten by far rua .
happy .
his thumb told him so .
terrified .
disappointed .
he heard three whistles .
far rua was going to defeat him .
she had got him out of many troubles .
his wife told him to .
ridiculous .
finn was always hiding .
to distract far rua .
far rua 's teeth will fall out .
to know what finn 's child looked like .
shocked .
finn will be much stronger than far rua .

obey his orders exactly .
lock their door , and put the key in their pocket .
it was quite , quite certain they would never come back .
into rooms filled with beautiful things .

the woman spoke less and less , and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite frightened about her .
just raise one corner so that she may peep .
to his wife contented and happy .

the king had only a wretched old nag for the youngest .
a raven .
he was so starved .
it was easy to see he needed it .

because they would turn him into an animal .
in a little house in the woods .
because he was wounded .
worried .
to ask for the maiden 's hand in marriage .
jealous .
so she could sneak into the castle .
to hide her lost eye .
the lightning did that .
close to the field of buckwheat .
rye , wheat , and oats .
do you know anything more beautiful than we ? .
close your flowers , fold your leaves , and do n't look at the lightning .
the sight strikes human beings blind .
it was burned by the lightning .

canonbie dick .
a long string of horses .
bowden moor .
king arthur and his knights .
a venerable man .
rode along at a snail 's pace , thought over the bargains which he had made at the fair that day , and wondered when he was likely to dispose of his two remaining horses .
agreed to buy the animals , and , pulling a bag of gold from the pocket of his queerly cut breeches , he began to count out the price .
surprised .
unicorns , and bonnet - pieces , and other ancient coins .
the gold that the stranger gave him was not the gold that was in use at the time .
it was good , pure gold .
commissioned dick to get him other good horses at the same price .
the only stipulation he made being that dick should always bring them to the same spot , after dark , and that he should always come alone .
lead it over bowden moor after dark , and he was sure to meet the mysterious , white - headed stranger .
he never remembered having seen any opening in the hillside there before ? .
an enormous cavern lit by flaming torches .
follow the old man up the hall to the far end of it .
thomas the rhymer .
the horn .
thunder rolled in crashing peals through the immense hall .
sprang to their feet and seized their swords , brandishing them round their heads .
stamped , and snorted , and ground their bits , as if eager to escape from their stalls .
he was terrified at seeing so many threatening faces turned towards him .
made one weak , undecided effort to pick up the sword .
a perfect whirlwind of cold , raw air tore through the cavern , carrying the luckless horse - dealer along with it ; and , hurrying him along the narrow passage through which he had entered , dashed him down outside on a bank of loose stones and shale .
whispered the story of his weird and fearful adventure .
surprised .
the old man never provided him with something to drink .
he wanted to have refreshments .
the stranger gave him a warning .
scared .
the stranger wanted to reveal his identity .
nervous .
the spirits might believe he was a threat .

went into the wood and gone far and farther than far , over hill and dale .
she lost her little one .
clawing at the tree - stems so that the bark flew .
the cook , the musicians , the horses , and all .
she rolled off the bridge , and fell into the water , and there she burst .
she burst .
went to his own place .

out flew a star .
the girl pleaded and cried .
the two other rooms .
she had been alone for some time and had all sorts of thoughts as to what there might be in the second room .
the moon .
she was once more allowed to remain .
the girl was all alone and bored .
becoming the most beautiful of all maidens , without the power of speech .
leave this place .
a large , large wood .
she could not reach its end .
a high tree .
he wanted to see what it all meant .
coaxed her down , took her back home with him .
she was so beautiful .
the queen devoured her child .
after much pleading .
the virgin mary .
punished for that which she did .

sad .
annoyed .
the girl was bothersome .
open the third door .
excited .
she needed to be punished .
she thought the girl 's reflection was her own .
the prince 's mother objected to their marriage .
to exact revenge on the girl .
devastated .
she could not speak .
happy .
baked pancakes for them .
seven .

a young daughter .
delighted .
the king 's son .
his second wife .
her godmother .
scooped out all the inside of it , having left nothing but the rind ; which done , she struck it with her wand , and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach , gilded all over with gold .
made a coachman out of him .
she ironed her sisters ' linen , and plaited their ruffles .
her two sisters .
the coach would be a pumpkin again . her horses , coachman , footmen , and clothes would become just as they were before .
employed cinderella in the meanest work of the house .
three huge rats .
the king 's son had desired her .
took up most carefully .
she was very meanly dressed , and had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman .
rose up and fled .
the gentleman found it went on very easily , and fitted her as if it had been made of wax .
gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace and matched them with two great lords of the court .
forgive them .
cinderella had unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper . the second wife was the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen .
cinderella asked if she had to go there in these nasty rags .
she needed to pretend she was at home .
it was after midnight .
that he would get a princess , from far , far away , and tat she was as white as milk , and as red as blood , and so rich that her riches had no end .
she was so beautiful and winning that he could not go on living without her .
split at it .
the youth returned with two men , and asked him in their presence whether he refused the dead man christian burial .
he had but a few shillings left in his pocket .
asked him whether he did not find it tiresome to wander along all alone .
he always had something to think about .
his comrade .
a witch .
she remained seated .
a sword that hung above the door .
a ball of golden twine .
she heard that she would have to sit there until the day of judgement if she did not give up the hat .
the three witches wpuld cross and tear them to pieces .
the princess of whom the youth dreamed .
take the shears and keep them and give them back to the princess to - morrow at noon .
secretly robbed him of the shears without his noticing .
unhappy .
fly through the air more swiftly than he could walk on level ground .
the comrade put on the three - sisters hat , which made him invisible .
to her dearest who waits for her in the hill .
swung himself up in back again .
keep the princess ' ball of twine for her and have it back by to - morrow noon .
while they ere in the midst of their merry play .
the goat .
there was no ball in it .
the ball of gold twine .

weld an additional twenty - four pounds of iron on his sword .
the weather .
the comrade kept giving the princess a cuff here , and a cuff there , until she had received a terrible drubbing .
the troll must accompany her .
hewed off the troll 's head and went up with it to the youth 's room .
she had to take the youth as she had promised .
close his eyes and pretend to sleep .
she was lovelier than she had ever been before .
the castle court - yard was so full they could scarcely get through .
they were loaded so heavily with gold and silver that they had to walk on the ground and were not strong enough to rise into the air .
half of all that the youth may gain in the course of the next five years .
went back and forth with the goats and his father 's twelve horses , bringing all the gold and silver home .
the youth had sacrificed all he had in order that he might have peace , and a burial in consecrated ground .
grateful .

the eagle will send daniel down to the ground .
the eagle 's nest last year .
spreaded out his great big wings , burst out a laughing , and flew away like lightning .
a door opened right in the middle of the moon , creaking on its hinges as if it had not been opened for a month before .
by his bush .

the man on the moon gave the door such a great bang after him .
gave two bangs to the handle of the reaping - hook that was holding daniel up .

sheen went softly and sat down beside murtough on the turfy hunting mound .
wonder .
at one moment all his nature was filled with longing and with love of her , so that it seemed to him that he would give the whole of ireland for the loan of one hour 's space of dalliance with her ; but after that he felt a dread of her , because he knew his fate was in her hands , and that she had come to work him ill .
she was the beloved of murtough .
glad .
she appeared to him so fair that the king was ready to promise her anything in life she wished , so long as she would go with him to cletty of the boyne .
cletty of the boyne .
take her to his house .
murtough feared that when those that were of the christian faith were put out of his house , she would work her spells upon him , and no power would be left with him to resist those spells .
her name must never be uttered , nor must any man or woman learn it .
for ' storm ' .
he brought her to his home , and drove out the clerics that were there , with his wife and children along with them , and drove out also the nobles of his own clan , the children of niall , two great and gallant battalions .

her heart was lifted within her , and " fair as a fairy palace is this house of cletty , " said she .
robed himself in all the splendour of his royal dignity .
never on earth was to be seen a woman more goodly of appearance than she .
it seemed to him that the power of a great goddess of the ancient time was in her .
he feared her , feeling that his fate was in her hands .
she knew that the king was in their power , now that she was there alone with him , and the clerics and the christian teachers gone .
like thee , a daughter of the race of men of the ancient family of adam and of eve ; fit and meet my comradeship with thee .

she took of the water of the boyne and made a magic wine thereout .
she took ferns and spiked thistles and light puff - balls of the woods , and out of them she fashioned magic swine and sheep and goats .
all their strength went from them .
at one side of the house .
these were headless men , fighting like human beings , yet finished at the neck .
murtough , in his sleep and in his dreams , heard the battle - shout .
the wine overcame him , and his strength departed from him , and he fell helplessly upon the floor .
the phantoms were but stones and sods and withered leaves of the forest that he took for fighting men .
to arise and to gather together the clans of the children of his people , the men of owen and of niall .
angry .
the clans of owen and of niall .
they returned to their own country .
to seek murtough .
sheen threw her spell upon the king , so that he could not break away .
so that the king would not dare to go out amongst them .
she went everywhere throughout the house , and took lighted brands and burning torches , and scattered them in every part of the dwelling .
the king had spoken her name , for she knew by that that the hour of her revenge had come .
he heard the crash of falling timbers and the noise of the magic hosts , and he smelled the strong smell of fire in the palace .
she caused a great snowstorm to come round the house so that drifts of deep snow were piled against the walls , blocking the doors and chilling the folk that were feasting within the house .
he slept again and he saw a vision .
her eyrie on the dismal cliff outhanging o'er the ocean .
murtough and the griffin were enveloped in the flame .
he made one plunge forward seeking for the magic hosts .
