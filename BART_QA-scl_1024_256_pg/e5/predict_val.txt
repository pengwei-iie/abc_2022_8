he had been able to find his way there .
the little page - boy .
a stately castle .
the great earl .
anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in the shimmer .
he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees and catching butterflies .
he knew that it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the .
keep far away from the fairy knowe .
the little folk were not to trust to .
fairies .
walked a good half - mile out of their way .
everyone knew that fairies come abroad in the darkness , and the door of their dwelling stands .

crept out of the castle by the little postern door , and stole down the stone steps .
anxious .
he found that what everyone said was true .
scores of the tiny folk , fairies and elves .
stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene .

the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water .
he did not want to drink the water .
sprang to the opening of the knowe , through which he could see the stars glimmer .
some poor mortal .
he had once heard that if anyone walked on the wet sands , where the waves came over .
the beautiful cup remained in the castle as a witness of his adventure .

the little folk could go no step further , but stood on the dry sand uttering cries .
in the giant 's garden .
stopped their games in order to listen to them .
the giant .
run away .
tried to play on the road .
glad .
a little boy .
he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree .
the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away .
his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming .
the tree broke at once into blossom , and birds came and sang on it .
he grew very old and feeble .
hastened across the grass , and came near to the child .
the child .
paradise .
the poor children had now nowhere to play .
knocked down the wall .
the giant cried in a very gruff voice .
he did not want the children to play in his garden .
the giant was too selfish .
the child was too tiny .
shocked .
kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow .
he was out most of the day at work in the fields .
kept a tame sparrow .
taught her little tricks .
the old woman had never loved the sparrow , and often quarreled with her husband .
scolded and even cursed the poor little bird for her bad behavior .
delighted .
the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping .
very disappointed .
he quickened his steps , hastily drew off his straw sandals and stepped on to the .
asked her again and again , insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet .
she wanted to tell her husband what had happened to his pet sparrow .
he was too kind - hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife .
he would go and look for the sparrow on tomorrow .
over the hills and through the woods .
a large bamboo wood .
bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her .
she had a new tongue .
happy .
she was a fairy .
he had found his lost sparrow .
a beautiful house in the heart of bamboo grove .
astonished .
all the kindness he had shown her for many long years .
all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
he could return home with a light heart .
the darkness .
forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife .
comfort .
he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at him not coming home .
two boxes .
he was now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box .
helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off .
he found his wife even crosser than usual .
to pacify her .
gold and silver coins .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
overjoyed .
it was light and easy to carry home .
she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .
she made up her mind , if possible, to get more .
her greed to get the big box made her forget everything else .
hastened to the door and knocked loudly .
she remembered that she had once been her mistress .
