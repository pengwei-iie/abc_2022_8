in the shadow of the cowhouse .
barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went through the orchard and .
denis did not care for her anymore .
was fond of talking himself , but not of listening to any one else .
when he had taught her all the songs , and told her all of the plans he had .
put her water - pot on her shoulder and went slowly down to the spring .
to distract tephany .
amuse him and keep him with her .
the feather .
to amuse solomon and keep him with her .
she talked too much .
tephany had not been able to resist the pleasure of putting the feather in her hair .

tephany did not come back with the pin .
tephany would be as wise as solomon himself .
happy .
surprised .
denis began to agree with them .
he would not listen to her .
it was too late , denis would never come back .
she wanted to reveal her beauty .
the sight of aziliez 's face .
she , and was only a poor peasant girl .
tephany was forced , much against her will , to remain where she was .
scared .
try to win a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as .
the young men , whose heads were turned by the girl 's beauty , began to quarrel .
so she could escape with the pig .
wild with fear .
he was too busy .
freedom to see denis .
she did not want to give denis his daughter .
mad .
she saw that each tear - drop was a round and shining pearl .

she did not want to upset tephany .
half choked .
she .
barbaik never trusted anyone and was afraid of being cheated .

a tremendous quantity of birds and game .
several hundred knights .
to guard the roads and carry messages .
a personage .

stepped up to them .
her 's attendants .
returned to earth again with the sorcerers .
written down and sung to the accompaniment of flutes of jasper in his pear - .
they will find a castle .
he was able to find his way there .
the little page - boy .
a stately castle .
the great earl .
so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in .
he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees and catching butterflies .
he knew that it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the .
keep far away from the fairy knowe .
the little folk were not to trust to .
the abode of fairies .
walk a good half - mile out of their way , even in broad daylight .
everyone knew that fairies come abroad in the darkness , and the door of their dwelling stands .
he was an adventurous wight .

crept out of the castle by the little postern door , and stole down the stone steps .
nervousis .
he found that what everyone said was true .
the tiny folk , fairies , and elves , and gnomes .
stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene in wonder .
darted from the table to a tiny cupboard in the rock , and returned staggering under .
began to drink out of it in turn .
that no one poured wine into it , and yet it was always full .
wished for the wine that he loved best .
the fairies will be angry at him .
take that cup home with him .
veryan excited .
invite him to a seat at the table .
they will be rude to him .
they jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals , told him that they saw .
theyis .
the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water .
he did not want to drink the water .
sprang to the opening of the knowe .
some poor mortal .
he was trying to take him away from his home .
the little folk could go no step further , but stood on the dry sand uttering cries .
jumped across the water - mark on to the firm , wet sand .
jumped across the water - mark on to the firm , wet sand .
the beautiful cup remained in the castle as a witness of his adventure .

the butler grasped the stem of it tightly in his hand .

scared .
he was taken prisoner by the fairies .
angry .
the little page - boy was too strong .
the giant 's garden .
stopped their games in order to listen to them .
the giant .
play .
tried to play on the road , but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones .
glad .
a little boy .
he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree .
the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away .
hisis he did not see the giant coming .
the tree broke at once into blossom .
he grew very old and feeble .
hastened across the grass , and came near to the child .
the child .
paradise .
the poor children had now nowhere to play .
knocked down the wall .
the giant was very gruff .
he did not want people to play in his garden .
the giant was too selfish .
he .
surprised .
a good , kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow .
he was out most of the day at work in the fields .
kept a tame sparrow .
taught her little tricks .
the old woman had never loved the sparrow .
seized the sparrow and fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little bird 's .
delighted .
the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping .
very disappointed .
he quickened his steps , hastily drew off his straw sandals , and stepped on to .
gave her no peace , but asked her again and again , insisting that she must know what .
the old man gave her no peace .
he was too kind - hearted .
he would go and look for the sparrow on tomorrow .
over the woods .
near a large bamboo wood .
bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her .
she had a new tongue .
happy .
the old man knew that her sparrow was a fairy .
he .
a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove .
astonished .
he had shown her for many long years .
all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot .
the night came on and the darkness .
forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife .
happy .
he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at his not coming home .
two boxes .
itis easier for him to carry .
helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off , bidding .
he found his wife even crosser than usual .
to pacify her .
gold and silver coins and many other precious things .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
over .
they might have had twice as much silver and gold as this .
she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .
she made up her mind to get more .
she had treated the sparrow poorly .
hasten to the door and knocked loudly .
she remembered that she had once been her mistress .
she could not walk fast .
she .
a number of horrible and frightful looking demons .
frightenedened .
bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her .
ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her .
she was a regular cross - patch who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding .
angry .
guilty .
took her starch .
it was a bird .
the sparrow took her starch .
angry .
not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen .
distressed .
he had a bright thought .
he was very strong .
the sparrow 's daughters brought in on beautiful old - fashioned trays a feast of .
he had to put up with it all his life .
they might have had twice as much silver and gold as this .
the old woman had never loved the sparrow .
try to invade the sparrow 's house .
dislike .
she began to hurry homewards .
her husband told her to not be greedy .
whoever had enough to live on .
they began to grow poorer and pooere , and at last did not know when they .
took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune .
the dog hit upon an idea .
catch a mouse and gnaw a hole in the chest .
pleased .
took her on his back and swam across with her .
put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river , where the dog was waiting .
the cat quickly climbed over the roof .
he had not helped to bring home the ring again .
sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word .
she had robbed him of his reward .
angry .
chased her and tried to seize her .
whoever had enough to live on .
they did not have enough to eat .
the dog will try to seize her .
she , and so she reached home long before the dog .
the dog did not want to be blamed for stealing her prize .
the dog grew angry at the cat because she had robbed him of his reward .
