the castle he saw on the edge of the forest .
passed between the lions as though he did not see them , and right into the little room .
the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips , and beat him worse .
the bottle fell down , and its whole contents poured over the youth .
the youngest of them .
see how his parents fared .
a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it .
surprised .
the queen must go straight home , and he has used up both of his wishes .
sad .
he wanted to show the king what a man he had grown to be .
the wide world .
the beasts came when he blew his horn .
asked the king about whiteland .

an old woman .
rise and curtsey to the gentlewoman .
delighted .
walked straight into the pig - sty .

crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to the edge of the .
at the bottom of the quarry , beside the spring well .
spin away as fast as she could at a tiny spinning wheel .
