it was too late , denis would never come back .
she wanted to show tephany the peach .
to be in a disguise .
she only wanted to be the wife of denis .
tephany was forced , much against her will , to remain where she was .
scared .
try to win a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as .
the young men began to quarrel as to which should do most for her .
so she could escape with the group .

written down and sung to the accompaniment of flutes of jasper in his pear tree .
they will see a great castle .
he had been able to find his way there .
a little page - boy .
a stately castle .
the great earl .
so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in .
he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees and catching butterflies .
he knew that it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the .
keep far away from the fairy knowe .
the little folk were not to trust to .
the abode of fairies .
walk a good half - mile out of their way .
everyone knew that fairies come abroad in the darkness , and the door of their dwelling stands .
he was an adventurous wight .
see the fairies .
crept out of the castle by the little postern door , and stole down the stone steps .
anxious .
he found that what everyone said was true .
the tiny folk , fairies , and elves , and gnomes .
stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene .
darted from the table to a tiny cupboard in the rock , and returned staggering under .
began to drink out of it in turn .
no one poured wine into it , and yet it was always full .
wished for the wine that he loved best .
he will be tricked by the fairies .
take that cup home with him .
very pleased .
they will invite him to a seat at the table .
they will grow rude and insolent .
they jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals , told him that they saw .
they were not nice to him .
the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water .
he did n't want to drink the water .
sprang to the opening of the knowe .
the little fellow did not know this .
he had once heard that if anyone walked on the wet sands , where the waves had come .
his feet sank in the dry sand , his breath came in little gasps , and he .
jumped across the water - mark on to the firm , wet sand .
ran safely along the shore , his precious cup in his arms .
the beautiful cup remained in the castle as a witness of his adventure .
excited .
the fairies were not nice to him .
annoyed .
angry .
they gained on him steadily .
scared .
he was taken prisoner by the fairies .

the giant 's garden .
stopped their games in order to listen to them .
the giant .
run away .
tried to play on the road .
glad .
a little boy .
he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree .
the children saw him they were so frightened that they all ran away .
his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming .
the tree broke at once into blossom .
he was very old and feeble .
hastened across the grass , and came near to the child .
the child .
his garden .
he did not want the children to play .
knocked down the wall .
the giant was mean to them .
he did not want to allow the children to play in his garden .
the giant was too selfish .
he .
shocked .
a good , kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow .
he was out most of the day at work in the fields .
kept a tame sparrow .
taught her little tricks .
the old woman had never loved the sparrow .
seized the sparrow - who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head .
delighted .
the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping .
very disappointed .
he quickened his steps , hastily drew off his straw sandals , and stepped on to .
asked her again and again , insisting that she must know what had happened to his pet .
the old man gave her no peace .
he was too kind - hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife .
he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow .
over the hills and through the woods .
near a large bamboo wood .
bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her .
she had a new tongue .
happy .
she had a new tongue .
he had found his lost sparrow .
a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove .
astonished .
he had shown her for many long years .
all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot .
the night came on and the darkness .
forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife .
happy .
he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at his not coming home .
two boxes .
he was now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box .
helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off .
he was late .
he wanted to pacify her .
gold and silver coins .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
over excited .
she wanted to have more gold .
she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .
she made up her mind , if possible , to get more .
she had treated the sparrow poorly .
hastened to the door and knocked loudly .
she remembered that she had once been her mistress .
she could not walk fast .
she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small .
a number of horrible and frightful looking demons .
frightenedened .
bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her .
ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her .
she was a regular cross - patch , who spoiled the happiness of her home by her sc .
angry .
guilty .
took her starch .
she did not care what might happen to it .
the sparrow took her starch .
angry .
not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen .
distressed .
he had a bright thought .
he was very strong and did not need to rush .
the sparrow brought in a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
he had to put up with it all his life .
they might have had twice as much silver and gold as this .
the old woman had never loved the sparrow .
try to trick her .
dislike .
she was too proud .
she was told to be quiet .
whoever had enough to live on .
they began to grow poorer and pooere , and at last did not know when they .
took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune .
the dog hit upon an idea .
catch a mouse and gnaw a hole in the chest .
pleased .
took her on his back and swam across with her .
put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river , where the dog was waiting .
she quickly climbed over the roof .
he had not helped to bring home the ring again .
sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word .
she had robbed him of his reward .
angry .
chased her and tried to seize her .
whoever .
they did not know when they would get their next meal .
she will try to steal the ring from the dog .
she wanted to go to the house in which stood the chest .
the cat quickly climbed over the roof and brought the ring to her master .
the dog grew angry at the cat , because she had robbed him of his reward .
