the child .
his garden .
he .
knocked down the wall .
they did not want to be beaten by the giant .
so that the children would not play in it .
because the giant was too selfish .
he ruined the little boy 's life .

all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot .
the night came on and the darkness .

happy .
he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at his not coming home .

he was now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box .

she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .

she had treated the sparrow poorly .
