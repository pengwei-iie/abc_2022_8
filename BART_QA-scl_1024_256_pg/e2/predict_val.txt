the little page - boy .
a stately castle .
the great earl .
anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in the shimmer .
he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees and catching butterflies .
he knew that it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the .
keep far away from the fairy knowe .
the little folk were not to trust to .
the abode of fairies .
walked a good half - mile out of their way , even in broad daylight .
they did not want to run the risk of going too near the fairy knowe and bringing .

to visit their abode .
crept out of the castle by the little postern door and stole down the stone steps , .
excited .
he found that what everyone said was true .
scores of the tiny folk , fairies and elves .
stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene .
darted from the table to a tiny cupboard in the rock , and returned staggering under .

the poor children had now nowhere to play .
knocked down the wall .
the giant did not allow them to play in his garden .
he did not want the children to play in his garden .
the autumn gave golden fruit to every garden .
he was selfish .
shocked .
good , kind - hearted .
he was out most of the day at work in the fields .
kept a tame sparrow .
saved some tit - bits from his meal with which to feed her little bird .
the old woman had never loved her .
seized the sparrow - who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head .

he felt sure that his wife , in one of her cross tempers had shut the sp .
gave her no peace , but asked again and again .
she did not want to know what had happened to his pet .
he was too kind - hearted to punish his be shrew of a wife .
he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow .
over the hills and through the woods .
near a large bamboo wood .
bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her .
she had a new tongue .
happy .
she was a fairy .
he had found his lost sparrow .
a beautiful house in the heart of bamboo grove .
astonished .
all the kindness he had shown her for many long years .
all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot .
the night came on and the darkness .
forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife .
happy .
he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at him not coming home .
two boxes .
he was now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box .
helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off , bidding .
it was late on in the night and she had been waiting up for him for a long .
he wanted to pacify her .
gold and silver coins .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
overjoyed .
she was greedy .
she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .
she made up her mind , if possible, to get more .
her greed to get the big box made everything else forget .
hastened to the door and knocked loudly .
she remembered that the old woman had once been her mistress .
she could not walk fast , much less run .
she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small .
a number of horrible and frightful looking demons .
scared .
they surrounded her as if they intended to kill her .
ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her , glad to escape .
she was a regular cross - patch .
angry .
confused .
made some more rice - paste , grumbling all the time at the trouble .
she did not care what might happen to it and without the smallest pity for its suffering .
it was all gone .
angry .
he was very disappointed .
distressed .
he had decided to go and look for the sparrow on the morrow .
he found himself near a large bamboo wood .
some of the sparrow 's daughters performed a wonderful dance .
she had suffered at the hands of her old wife .
they might have had twice as much silver and gold .
she did not do anything to deserve it .
go to the sparrow 's house .
hatred .
she was rushing home .
she became a good old woman .
whoever owned it always had enough to live on .
they began to grow poorer and poorer , and at last did not know when they would get .
sold the ring for a small sum .
they might restore to their owners their former good fortune .
catch a mouse and gnaw at the chest .
pleased .
took her on his back and swam across with her .
put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river , where the dog was waiting .
she quickly climbed over the roof .
he had not helped to bring home the ring again .
sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word .
she had robbed him of his reward .
angryful .
chased her and tried to seize her .
they did not know when their next meal would come .
they did not know when their next meal would be .
the dog will be angry at her .
she wanted to go home .
the dog could only run along the ground .
she had robbed him of his reward .
