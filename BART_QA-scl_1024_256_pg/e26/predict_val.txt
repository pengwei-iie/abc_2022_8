he had been able to find his way there .
the little page - boy .
in a stately castle .
the great earl .
so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in .
he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees , and catching .

the little folk were not to trust to .
the abode of fairies .

crept out of the castle by the little postern door , and stole down the stone steps .
nervous .
he found that what everyone said was true .
the tiny folk , fairies , and elves , and gnomes .
stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene .
darted from the table to a tiny cupboard in the rock , and returned staggering under .

the giant .
play .
tried to play on the road .
glad .
a little boy .
he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree .
the children saw the giant they were so frightened that they all ran away .
his eyes were so full of tears .
the tree broke at once into blossom .
he was very old and feeble .
hastened across the grass , and came near to the child .
the child .
his garden .
he did not want the children to play .
knocked down the wall .
the giant was mean to them .
he did not want to allow the children to play in his garden .
the giant was too selfish .
he ruined the little boy 's life .
shocked .
a good , kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow .
he was out most of the day at work in the fields .
kept a tame sparrow .
saved some tit - bits from his meal with which to feed his little bird .
the old woman had never loved the sparrow .
seized the sparrow - who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head .
delighted .
see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him , ruffling out her .
very disappointed .
he called his wife and asked where suzume san was .
gave her no peace , but asked her again and again , insisting that she must know what .
the old man gave her no peace .
he was too kind - hearted .
he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow .
over the hills and through the woods .
near a large bamboo wood .
bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her .
she had a new tongue .
happy .
it had a new tongue .
he had found his lost sparrow .
a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove .
astonished .
he had shown her for many long years .
all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot .
theis .
forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife .
happy .
he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at him not coming home .
two boxes .
he was now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box .
helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off .
he was late .
he wanted to pacify her .
gold and silver coins and many other precious things .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
overed .
she wanted more gold and silver .
she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .
she made up her mind to get more .
she had treated the sparrow poorly .
hastened to the door and knocked loudly .
she remembered that she had once been her mistress .
she could not walk fast .
she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small .
a number of horrible and frightful looking demons .
frightened .
bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her .
ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her .
a regular cross - patch , who spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue .
angry .
guilty .
took its starch .
she did not care what might happen to it .
because the pet sparrow took her starch .
angry .
not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen .
distressed .
he decided to go and look for the sparrow on tomorrow .
he was very strong and did not need to rush .
the daughters brought in on beautiful old - fashioned trays a feast of all kinds of delicious .
he had to put up with it all his life .
they might have had twice as much silver and gold as this .
she did not care that her husband had to pay for the cost of keeping the pet .
try to catch her .
hatred .
she was too proud .
she saw the sparrow 's bright black eyes fixed on her face .
whoever owned it always had enough to live on .
they began to grow poorer and pooere , and at last did not know when they .
took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune .
the dog hit upon an idea .
catch a mouse and gnaw a hole in the chest .
pleased .
took her on his back and swam across with her .
put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river , where the dog was waiting .
she quickly climbed over the roof .
he had not helped to bring home the ring again .
sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word .
she had robbed him of his reward .
angry .
chased her and tried to seize her .
whoever owned it always had enough to live on .
they did not have enough to eat .
the dog will try to seize her .
she wanted to go to the house in which stood the chest .
the dog did not want to be blamed for stealing it .
the dog grew angry at the cat because she had robbed him of his reward .
