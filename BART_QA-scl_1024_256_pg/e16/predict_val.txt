the young men were angry at her .
so she could escape with the group .

a tremendous quantity of birds and game .
several hundred knights .
to guard the roads and carry messages .
a personage .
serve him faithfully as one of his officials .
took his book and struck at them .
they all scattered , wriggling and crawling out of the door .
followed them and dug up the earth in the place where they had disappeared .
built a large fire and smoked them out .

so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in .
he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees and catching butterflies .
it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the open air .
keep far away from the fairy knowe .
the little folk were not to trust to .
the abode of fairies .
walked a good half - mile out of their way .
everyone knew that fairies would punish any rash mortal who came too near them .
he was an adventurous wight .
visit their abode .
crept out of the castle by the little postern door .
anxiousress .
he found that what everyone said was true .
the tiny folk .
stood in a dark corner watching the busy scene .
darted from the table to a tiny cupboard in the rock , and returned staggering under .
began to drink out of it in turn .
no one poured wine into the cup .
wished for the wine that he loved best .
the fairies will be angry at him .
take that cup home with him .
veryable .
invite him to a seat at the table .
they will be rude to him .
jeered at him for being content to serve mere mortals , telling him that they .
they were rude to him .
the ruby wine was turned to clear cold water .
he knew that the fairies would be after him .
sprang to the opening of the knowe .
some poor mortal .
he had once heard that if anyone walked on the wet sands , where the waves had come .
the beautiful cup remained in the castle as a witness of his adventure .
jumped across the water - mark on to the firm , wet sand .
ran safely along the shore , his precious cup in his arms .

the giant 's garden .
stopped their games in order to listen to them .
the giant .
run away .
tried to play on the road .
glad .
a little boy .
he was so small that he could not reach up to the branches of the tree .
the children were so frightened .
his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming .
the tree broke at once into blossom .
he was very old and feeble .
hastened across the grass , and came near to the child .
the child .
paradise .
he wanted to protect the youngest children .
knocked down the wall .
the giant was very gruff .
he did not want to allow the children to play in his garden .
the giant was too selfish .
the giant stole a little boy 's ring .
shocked .
a good , kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow .
he was out most of the day at work in the fields .
kept a tame sparrow .
taught her little tricks .
because she had never loved the sparrow .
seized the sparrow and fetched the scissors and cut off the poor little bird 's .
delighted .
see his pet come flying and chirping to meet him , ruffling out her .
very disappointed .
he quickened his steps , hastily drew off his straw sandals and stepped on to the .
confessed all .
the old man gave her no peace .
he was too kind - hearted .
he would go and look for the sparrow on tomorrow .
over the woods .
near a large bamboo wood .
bowed her little head and went through a number of tricks her master had taught her .
she had a new tongue .
happy .
she had a new tongue .
he had found his lost sparrow .
a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove .
astonished .
he had shown her for many long years .
all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot .
the night came on .
forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife .
happy .
he must return to his old wife - who would probably be cross at him not coming home .
two boxes .
he was now too old and feeble to carry the big and heavy box .
helped him put it on his back and went to the gate .
he was late on in the night .
to pacify her .
gold and silver coins .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
overjoyed .
because she was greedy .
she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .
she made up her mind , if possible , to get more .
she had treated the sparrow poorly .
hastened to the door and knocked loudly .
she remembered that she had once been her mistress .
she could not walk fast .
she supposed this big box to be full of gold and silver and precious jewels like the small .
a number of horrible and frightful looking demons .
frightenedened .
bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her .
ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her .
she was a regular cross - patch .
angry .
guilty .
made some more rice - paste , grumbling all the time at the trouble .
she did not care what might happen to it .
the sparrow took her starch .
mad .
not even the shadow of his dear sparrow was to be seen .
distressed .
he had a bright thought .
he was very strong .
the wife brought in a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
she had suffered at the hands of the old wife .
it was light and easy to carry home .
the old woman treated the sparrow poorly .
try to trick her .
dislike .
she was too quick .
she saw the sparrow 's bright black eyes fixed on her face .
whoever owned it always had enough to live on .
they began to grow poorer and pooere , and at last did not know when they .
took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune .
the dog hit upon an idea .
catch a mouse and fetch out the ring .
pleased .
took her on his back and swam across with her .
put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river .
she quickly climbed over the roof .
he had not helped to bring home the ring again .
sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word .
she had robbed him of his reward .
angry .
chased her and tried to seize her .
whoever owned it always had enough to live on .
the ring was gone .
the dog will try to seize her .
