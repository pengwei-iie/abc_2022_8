sat down on the rocks .
he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it .
anxious .
it being his only one .
he had failed to find any game while hunting that day .
he saw the happy hunter searching about on the shore .
return the brother 's bow and arrow .
bore his brother 's scornful scolding with humility and patience .
he had a bad disposition .
to kill the happy hunter and usurp his place as ruler of japan .
he owed his elder brother obedience .
returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook .
an old man .
stood on the beach , lost in perplexity and wondering what he had best do next .
a stick .
the hook was nowhere here .
near by on this shore .

what his trouble is and ask him to find the hook for him .
happy .
tell ryn jin , the dragon king of the sea .
a small boat .
seemed to go through the water of its own accord .
he caught sight of the gate and the roof of the sea king 's palace .
beautiful red coral .
numberless sloping roofs and gables , its huge gateways , and its .
it was fast closed .
a well full of fresh spring water .
he did not want to go in .

reflected in the deep still water .
never before had they seen the face of mortal man .
their curiousity .
they were still with wonder and could not find a word to say to him .
sprang down lightly from the tree .
with both hands .
placed the jewel in the cup and returned it to them .

all his courtiers and the servants of the palace , and the chief fish of the sea .
robes of ceremony .
a great feast was now spread before the king and his royal guest .
some music .
the happy hunter seemed to forget his trouble and why he had come at all to the sea .
arranged themselves and their fins in order .

planned and watched for an opportunity to kill him .
amazed .
he had a kind heart and could not bear the sight of his brother 's distress .
he humbled himself before the happy hunter and asked him to forgive him all the wrong he .
he wanted to try hunting .
he and his brother decided to make a change .
the happy hunter knew nothing of fishing , and the skillful fisher did as much about hunting .
he and his brother had been at it for a long time .
he .
there was never a fish at the end of it , only the hook and bait .
the happy hunter will be beaten .
anxious .
the brother would lose his only hook .
they were of no use to him .
he was grateful to the old man .
the distance was much shorter than he had expected .
the happy hunter and his servants were about to draw water .
he was a thirsty traveler in a strange land .
they were going to help him get his brother 's forgiveness .
he was going to meet his father .
the sea king 's palace was at the bottom of the sea .
politely .

the sound of what seemed like the approaching steps of several people .
his friends .
he thought that his friends had come to look for him .
hundreds of demons .
he lost his balance and fell out of the hollow tree .
the tree was in the background .
sitting round , some drinking and some dancing .
he .
run away .
if he did n't please them they may kill him .
shocked .
whether he pleased these strange creatures or not .
his largest wine - cup .
his skill had given them much pleasure .
to dance for the demon .
a wen on his right cheek .
the merry troop of demons suddenly vanished .
bewildered .
the old man was lost in bewilderment .

he would understand her sign language .
save him .
he will ask for the prince 's permission to take rose - red away .
gave strict orders that the matter should not be mentioned , and that investigations should be made in .
one of the prince 's servants saw her , and informed his master .
he could not conceal the matter .
rose - red was now his wife .

sad .
he reigned alone .
because so many people came to celebrate .

the monkey will ask for directions .
he shall then be able to act as guide and show the monkey all of the sights of .
