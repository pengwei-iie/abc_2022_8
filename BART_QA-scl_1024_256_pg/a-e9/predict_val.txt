the page - boy .
a stately castle .
the great earl .
so that anyone who liked could go down there in the pleasant summer mornings and bathe in .
he could run about as much as he liked , chasing bumble - bees and catching butterflies .
it was good for a healthy little lad to have plenty of fun in the open air .

he was so small that could not reach up to the branches of the tree .
the giant stole up behind him and took him gently in his hand , and put him up .
his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming .
the tree broke at once into blossom .
