hisis so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming .
theis has gone away .
he was old and feeble .
hastened across the grass , and came near to the child .
theis .
paradise .
he .
knocked down the wall .
theis not a good fit for them .
he did not want to allow the children to play in his garden .
the giant was too selfish .
he .
happy .
a good , kind - hearted , hard - working old fellow .
he .
kept a tame sparrow .
open her cage and let her fly about the room , and they would play together .
theis .
seized the sparrow - who all this time had spread out her wings and bowed her head .
delighted .
the time when he should reach his gate and see his pet come flying and chirping .
very disappointed .
he .
gave her no peace , but asked her again and again , insisting that she must know what .
the old man gave her no peace .
he .
he would go and look for the sparrow on the morrow .
over .
near a large bamboo wood .
bowed her little head and went through a number of the tricks her master had taught her .
she .
happy .
it .
he .
a beautiful house in the heart of the bamboo grove .
astonished .
he had shown her for many long years .
all her family .
a feast of all kinds of delicious foods .
the hours flew by too quickly in this lovely spot .
theis .
forget all she had suffered at the hands of his cross old wife .
happy .
he .
two boxes .
it .
helped him put it on his back and went to the gate to see him off , bidding .
he .
so she would know he was there .
gold and silver coins and many other precious things .
give up work and live in ease and comfort the rest of his days .
overjoyed .
they .
she began to reproach the old man for not having brought home the big box of presents .
she .
she had treated the sparrow poorly .
hastened to the door and knocked loudly .
she , was a polite bird .
she .
she .
a number of horrible and frightful looking demons bounced out of the box and surrounded her as .
frightened .
bounced out of the box and surrounded her as if they intended to kill her .
ran from the spot as fast as her quaking legs would carry her .
she spoiled the happiness of her home by her scolding tongue .
angry .
guilty .
took her starch and went without it .
she .
the sparrow took her starch .
angry .
he .
shocked .
he .
he .
theis .
he had to put up with it all his life .
they might have had twice as much silver and gold as this .
theis .
try to go back home .
hatred .
she .
her .
whoever had enough to live on .
they .
took counsel together as to how they might restore to their owners their former good fortune .
the dog hit upon an idea .
catch a mouse and gnaw a hole in the chest .
pleased .
took her on his back and swam across with her .
put the ring in her mouth and went back to the river , where the dog was waiting .
she quickly climbed over the roof .
he .
sat by the fireplace , purred and said never a word .
she .
angry .
chased her and tried to seize her .
whoever .
they .
theis going to attack her .
she .
theis .
theis a good creature and they should not be attacked .
