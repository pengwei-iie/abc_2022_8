the fox was very glad to see it , for he had had no food for two days .
near the king 's castle .

the son found he had forgotten his handkerchief .
an old man with a great , white beard .
three princesses .

three trolls .
the castle he saw on the edge of the forest .
he took the bottle and anointed himself , grasped the sword and killed the troll .
the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips , and beat him worse .
the bottle fell down , and its whole contents poured over the youth .
the youngest of them .
see how his parents fared .
a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it .
surprised .
the queen must go straight home , and he has used up both of his wishes .
sad .
he wanted to show the king what a man he had grown to be .
the wide world .
they came when he blew his horn .
gave him a pair of snowshoes .
the man .
he was cook there for fully ten years .
the king had not come home again .
a hat , a cloak and a pair of boots .
make can make himself invisible , and wish himself away as far as ever he will .
wished himself far away .

he .
he had gone to a fair one day , and had never come back again .
a little baby - boy .
times were bad .
worked all day amongst her cows , and pigs , and hens .
rent - day was coming on .
she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a long way towards paying her rent .
she .
an old woman .
rise and curtsey to the gentlewoman .
delighted .
walked straight into the pig - sty .
rocked to and fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could not understand .
a tiny bottle with a liquid that looked like oil in it .
happy .
she felt that her rent was safe .
kiss the hem of the strange lady 's green gown .
his son .
gave a piteous cry .
the laws of fairy - land said she could not take him until the third day after this .
sat in her kitchen and cried , and hugged her baby tighter in her arms .
sit in her kitchen and cry , and hug her baby tighter in her arms .
the whirr of a spinning wheel and the sound of a voice lilting a song .
in the fir wood behind the house .
crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to the edge of the .
at the bottom of the quarry , beside the spring well .
spin away as fast as she could at a tiny spinning wheel .
whippety - stourie .
she heard the whirr of a spinning wheel and the sound of a voice lilting .
tease the fairy for a few minutes .
crumpled up her nice clean cap , and screwed up her face .
the pig .
her bairn .
excited .
sad .
her cherished pig was on its back , with its legs in the air and its eyes shut .
because she lost her husband .
hear how much she wad gie her if he cured him .
she .
the beast jumped , and , with a grunt of contentment , ran off to its trough .
she was a fairy .
sad .
she knew now what she had not guessed before .
find out her name .
surprised .
she remembered the quarry .
she heard the whirr of a spinning wheel and the sound of a voice lilting .
she did not want to reveal that her child was missing .
she was trying to trick the prince .
they did n't need to eat the bacon .
surprised .
the fairy thought she was not strong enough .
she was no beauty .
she was so angry that she could contain herself no longer .
