three trolls .
the castle he saw on the edge of the forest .
he passed between the lions as though he did not see them , and right into the little room .
the the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips .

the youngest of them .
see how his parents fared .
a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it .
