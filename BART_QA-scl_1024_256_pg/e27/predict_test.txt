he was mingled with the crowd .
angry .
he fell into a rage .
a fisherman .
by the shore of the big sea .
by the shore of the big sea .
a red rock out in the sea .
salmon .
salmon .
salmon in spring , for herring in summer , and for cod .
sailed to the nearest town , sold their fish , and went to church on sunday .

matte and maie .
tobacco .
a cow .
they had nothing to feed her on .
three young men .
a can of fresh milk .
herring .
he had never read kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old .
a mighty king .
all fish and animals of the deep .
he is very changeful and touchy .
stirs up the sea into a storm and drags the sailors down into the depths .
a shining silver coin .
a fairy cow .
some magic rhymes she had heard in her childhood from an old lame man .
he did not fish on sunday .
set only one net close to the shore .
began to hum the words of the magic rhyme , altering the words to suit the longing .
because they thought of how he had profaned sunday .
he did not want to go out into the sea .
the old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there .
exclaimed .
the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets , and every net was filled with fish .
went to sea .
the old one was too small for themselves and the men .
a large cottage , with a real lock to the door and a store - house for fish .
tons of salmon , herring , and cod .
the following morning , instead of one , three cows stood on the island .
a two - story house and fetch soil to make a garden .
thirty .
make a big dam .
the new steamer .
heap up sand and stones , and make their island as big again .
he gave her a slice of the moon , and the sun 's gold .
because they had nothing to feed her on .
sad .
because she did not have a cow .
they were the maidens .
he had never read kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old .
thankful .
regretted .
she heard about ahti and wanted to be with him .
delightful .
because she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter .
set the herring - net just this once .
because she wanted to try for the fairy cow .
she wanted to trick him .
because such songs are not for sunday .
to tell his wife that they were going to have a storm .
to see if his husband was hiding in the bushes .
the weathercock was squeaking .
the cow wandered peacefully up and down the shore , and never so much as even looked at .
shocked .
disbelief .
they ate the fish .
so she could sing to the fairies .
there will be a commotion in the sea , the waves bubbled and bubble like .
scared .
there prince lay , as famished as ever , gnawing the carcase of a .
amazed .
in a dear little cottage by the side of a burn .
they had enough to live on , and enough to do .
two sleek cows , five hens and a cock , an old cat , and two kittens .
looking after the cows , and the hens , andthe garden .
an oatmeal bannock .
took down her bakeboard , and put on her girdle , and baked a couple .
ran after it as fast as her legs would carry her .
she was old and the bannock was young .
a large newly thatched cottage .
sitting cross - legged on the top of a big table by the window , sewing away .
get hold of it and divide it between them .
it ran too quickly for the tailor .
his great shears .
a tiny cottage by the roadside .
delight .
her clue .
kirning .
cakes and cream .
the little bannock had no wish to be eaten up by the miller .
he was so busy .
looked up .
disappointedful .
picked up his hammer and ran after it .
the bannock came to a farmhouse , with a great stack of peats standing .
a farmhouse .
it was rare and good to eat .
surprised .

a shepherd 's cottage on the other side .

the bannock escaped over the hill behind the house .

try to catch it .
divide it between them .
grip the cake .
she was in such a hurry that she nearly upset the kirn .
eat it .
run into the dark corner behind the chair .
because it was cold .
it would come in handy after the porridge .
he wanted to get rid of it .
because he was worried about the bannock .
the fox was very glad to see it , for he had had no food for two days .
near the king 's castle .
caught fish for the king 's table .
the first new thing that had come into his house .
go out fishing with his father .
he found he had forgotten his handkerchief .
an old man with a great , white beard .
three princesses .
he will make his fortune .
three trolls .
the castle on the edge of the forest .
he passed between the lions as though he did not see them , and right into the little .
the troll who came this time had six heads and six whips , and beat him worse .
the bottle fell down , and its whole contents poured over the youth .
the youngest of them .
see how his parents fared .
a ring which had the power of granting two wishes to the one who wore it .
surprised .
he must go straight home , and he has used up both of his wishes .
sadched .
he wanted to show the king what a man he had grown to be .
back to his queen .
they came when he blew his horn .
gave him a pair of snowshoes .
theis .
he was cook there for fully ten years .
the king had not come home again .
a hat , a cloak and a pair of boots .
make himself invisible , and wish himself away as far as ever he will .
wished himself far away .
take him and carried him off .
he had grown thin and pale because he had wandered so long in his great distress .

he had gone to a fair one day , and had never come back again .
a little baby - boy .
times were bad .
worked all day amongst her cows , and pigs , and hens .
for rent - day was coming on .
she thought that the price that it would fetch would go a long way towards paying her rent .
she .
an old woman .
rise and curtsey to the gentlewoman .
delighted at having the animal 's life saved .
walked straight into the pig - sty .
rocked to and fro and muttering to herself in words which the widow could not understand .
a tiny bottle with a liquid that looked like oil in it .
happy .
she felt that her rent was safe .
kiss the hem of the strange lady 's green gown .
the fairy 's son .
gave a piteous cry .
the fairy wanted to reveal her name .
sat in her kitchen and cried , and hugged her baby tighter in her arms .
call back for the boy in three days .
the whirr of a spinning - wheel and the sound of a voice lilting a .
in the fir wood behind the house .
crept noiselessly through the bushes on her hands and knees to the edge of the .
at the bottom of the quarry , beside the spring well .
spin away as fast as she could at a tiny spinning wheel .

the fairy said she would come back .
tease the fairy for a few minutes .
crumpled up her nice clean cap , and screwed up her face , and pretended to .
the pig .
her bairn .
excited .
sadic .
the song was quickly changed into a cry of despair .
because she lost her husband .
hear how much the pig wad gie her .
she was too much delighted at having the animal 's life saved .
the beast jumped , and , with a grunt of contentment , ran off to its trough .
she did not want to marry the green - clad lady .
sad .
she knew now what she had not guessed before .
find out the fairy 's name .
surprised .
she remembered the quarry .
she heard the whirr of a spinning - wheel and the sound of a voice lil .
she dare not , in case the wicked old dame heard her and threw some other spell .
she was trying to trick the fairy .
they did n't need to eat the bacon .
