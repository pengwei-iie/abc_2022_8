four of them killed the fisher's son and left him, then went to bed .

their luck had turned and they had brought back scarcely anything .
he was still alive .
she did not want to take care of him .
he was sure that the deer would take care of him .
there was no food left for them to eat .
they began to quarrel .
a little white cottage .
the church that is yonder .
he did not wake up .
gave it up, and lifted his arm .
sad .
the name that was written underneath his arm .
the air was filled with music .
laid his head on her knee, and combed his hair with a golden comb .
a beautifully wrought box .
she said it was the last chance, and she would never be allowed to come any more .
sad .
search the whole world through till he found her .
a year and a day .
shake them off, and turn their toes to the known, and their heels to the unknown .
another pair of shoes .
she has a son who is keeper of the birds of the air and sends them to sleep .
very kind, but had no counsel to give him .
get into the bag and put meat in it .
in flew an eagle through the open door, and picked it up in her claws and carried .
three tiny little birds flew out, and flapping their wings they asked .
the kingdom of the king under the waves .
nervous .
horse-race .
the winner was to have the king's daughter as wife .
never had the young man seen anything so splendid .
to prove his worth .
the king ordered another race to be run .
he was so dirty and ugly and had such a strange appearance .
he happened to raise his arm .
scared .
conducted him into the palace, and bathed in a marble bath .
the birds in the box told him .

in a very bad temper indeed .
the sight of her wreath .
tied his horse to a tree and followed where the sound led him .
he wished him to marry a neighbouring princess .
an old witch .
too happy .
pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water where she instantly .
she wanted to use the trick on her .
left the room at once .
the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea .
very sad .

sad .
he did not know how he could manage to get so much as a bit of hay for .
a large man .
old hopgiant .
the poor man's heart grew less heavy, and he gave over worrying .
he saw how the others took hold, and that he himself would not be able to do .
laughed .
old hopgiant .
when the giant began to mow and fling about his scythe, they were .
frightened .
rushed up and gave the giant a good kick .
his foot stuck to the giant, while the latter no more felt the kick than if it .

because of his matchless skill as a hunter .
fishing .
they .
so that now they must both be tired, he of his fishing and iof my hunting .
his brother and himself decided to make a change .
this talk .
the happy hunter knew nothing of fishing, and the skillful fisher who was bad tempered .
they had been following their favorite occupation for a long time .
he would have been able to catch plenty of fish .
sat .
there was never a fish at the end of it, only the hook and the bait .
he will be beaten .
he had lost his hook without even knowing when he had dropped it .
anxious .
it being his only one .
he had failed to find any game while hunting that day .
anxious .
he had failed to find any game while hunting that day .
he did not agree to the idea .
return the bow and arrow .
he bore his brother's scornful scolding with humility and patience .
they were of no use to him .
his brother had a bad disposition .
kill his brother and usurp the position as ruler of japan .
he owed his elder brother obedience .
returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook .
an old man .
stood up and looked in the direction that which the old man had taken .
a stick .
the hook was nowhere there .
near by on this shore .
the dragon king of the sea .
the bottom of the sea .
to ask the dragon king of the sea for his help .
happy .
tell ryn jin, the dragon king of the sea .
he wanted to get out of japan .
a small boat .
seemed to go through the water of its own accord .
he caught sight of the gate and roof of the sea king's palace .
the distance was much shorter than he had expected .
beautiful red coral .
a large place it was, with its numberless sloping roofs and gables, .
it .
in the tree overhanging the well .
he saw that it was fast closed, and also there was no one about whom he could .
the happy hunter had always heard that ryn gu was inhabited by dragons and similar terrible creatures .
surprised .
golden buckets .
draw water .
the couple drew water from a well .
glanced timidly upwards to see the cause of the unusual reflection .
never before had they seen the face of mortal man .
their curiousity .
their tongues were still with wonder and could not find a word to say to him .
sprang down lightly from the tree .
they were thirsty .
with both hands .
cut off one of the strange curved jewels (magatama) .
surprised .
the eldest daughter of ryn jin, king of the sea .
they were talented in fishing .
he was sure to say that good fortune has befallen him .
it .
it was at the bottom of the sea .
all his courtiers and the servants of the palace, and the chief fish of the sea .
his robes of ceremony .
kindly .
a wonderful array of sea creatures it was that waited upon the happy hunter .
some music .
the happy hunter seemed to forget his trouble and why he had come at all to the sea .
summoned them all here and asked him .
arranged themselves and their fins in order .
the tai has not been able to eat anything and he seems to be suffering from a .
his usually red face was pale, and his eyes were nearly closed .

he heedlessly snapped at the bait which i saw in the water .
he felt the pains in his throat coming on again .
the cuttlefish .
over .
since his lost hook was thus happily recovered he did not wish to make more trouble for the .
ryn jin forgave his subject at once .
get back to his own kingdom and make peace with his angry brother .
three years .
the sea king's kindness .
try to go back home .
sad .
two tide-jewels of the sea .
the nanjiu and the kanjiu .
command the sea to roll in and flood the land at any time that he wills .
very glad .
they would preserve him in case of danger from enemies at any time .
a large crocodile .
the sea king .
beg his brother's forgiveness .
evil .
glad .
he planned and watched for an opportunity to kill him .
use the jewels of the flow and ebb of the tide to prove whether what the sea .
amazed .
he had a kind heart and could not bear the sight of his brother's distress .
he learned now that he was making a fatal mistake to set himself against his brother .
a farmer .
since they were very sweet and fragrant .
angry .
began to call him names .
give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go .
took some money, bought a pear and gave it to the bonze .
thanked him .
take his pick-ax and cut down the tree .
it will turn into a tree .
to get a pear .
angry .
he had been mingled with the crowd .
the farmer turned around to look after his cart .
angry .
he wanted to get out of there .
his pears had all disappeared .
there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall .
burst out into loud laughter .
to a little town called the Peach .
a bonze .
such strange things kept happening there .
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during the night .
there were ghosts enough in the mill as it is .
a pinch of flour in the house with which to make mush .
lit a fire under the big tar-barrel that was standing there, got the mill .
a girl .
kept her seat, and went on knitting .
the woman built it up again .
angry .
