an old witch .
happy .
pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water .
she did not want the princess to talk .
left the room at once .
the rightful bride had really been drowned in the sea .

hohodemi .
the fourth mikoto .
he was not only as handsome as his ancestress, but he also very strong and brave .
because of his matchless skill as a hunter .
fisher .
they thoroughly enjoyed their respective occupations .
he saw his brother go to the sea every day with fishing rod in hand and come lad .
his brother suggested they make a change .
this talk .
the happy hunter knew nothing of fishing and the skillful fisher .
he and his brother had been fishing for a long time .
he would have been able to catch plenty of fish .
sat on the rocks .
there was never a fish at the end of it .
he will learn a valuable lesson .
he had lost his hook without even knowing when he dropped it .
anxious .
it being his only one .
he had failed to find any game while hunting that day .
anxious .
he saw the happy hunter searching about on the shore .
the mistake of their trying unfamiliar tasks is soon seen .
return his bow and arrows .
bore his brother's scornful scolding with humility and patience .
they were of no use to him .
he had a bad disposition .
kill his brother and usurp the ruler of japan .
he owed his elder brother obedience .
returned to the seashore and once more began to look for the missing hook .
an old man .

happy .
tell ryn jin, the dragon king of the sea .
he wanted to get out of japan .
a small boat .
it seemed to go through the water of its own accord .
he caught sight of the gate and roof of the sea king's palace .
shorter than he had expected .
beautiful red coral .
a large place .
it was fast closed .
the tree overhanging the well .
he saw that it was fast closed, and also had there was no one about whom he .
he had always heard that ryn gu was the realm of the dragon king under the sea .
surprised .
golden buckets .
draw water .
the well was dry .
reflected in the deep still water .
never before had they seen the face of mortal man .
their curiousity .

sprang down lightly from the tree .
they were thirsty .
with both hands .
cut off one of the strange curved jewels .
surprised .
the eldest daughter of ryn jin, king of the sea .
they helped him find his lost hook .
he would meet his father .
it was but seldom, perhaps only once in several hundred years .
it was at the bottom of the sea .
all his courtiers and the servants of the palace, and chief fish of the sea .
robes of ceremony .
politely .
a wonderful array of sea creatures it was that waited upon the happy hunter .
some music .
the happy hunter seemed to forget his trouble and why he had come at all to the sea .
summoned them all here and asked .
arranged themselves and their fins in order .
he was suffering from a bad throat .
his usually red face was pale, and his eyes were nearly closed .
he had been ill since yesterday .
he heedlessly snapped at the bait which i saw in the water .
he felt the pains in his throat coming on again .
the cuttlefish .
overjoyed .
he did not wish to make more trouble for the poor tai .
forgave his subject at once .
get back to his own kingdom and make peace with his angry brother .
three years .
the sea king's kindness .
try to return home .
sad .
two tide-jewels of the sea .
the nanjiu and the kanju .

they would preserve him in case of danger from enemies at any time .
a large crocodile .
the sea king .
beg his brother's forgiveness .
evil heart .
glad .
planned and watched for an opportunity to kill him .
use the jewels of the flow and ebb tide .
amazed .
he could not bear the sight of his brother's distress .
he learned now that he was making a fatal mistake to set himself against his brother .
a farmer .
they were very sweet and fragrant .
angry .
began to call him names .
give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go .
took some money, bought a pear and gave it to the bonze .
thanked .
cut down the tree .
the tree will grow .
he wanted to build a pit .

he was busy .
the farmer turned around to look after his cart .

his pears had all disappeared .
lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall .
burst into loud laughter .
to a market .
a bonze .
because such strange things kept happening there .
asked whether they would not allow her to grind a little flour during the night .
there were ghosts enough in the mill as it was .
a pinch of flour .
lit a fire under the big tar-barrel that was standing there; got it going .
a girl .
kept her seat, and went on knitting .
the woman built it up again .
