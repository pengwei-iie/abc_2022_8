to launch the boat and put out for sea .
he had not proceeded far when it found the fish cast up on shore , and so full .

she was going to lose her finest pig .
an old woman .
rise and curtsey to the gentlewoman .
delighted .
walked straight into the pig - sty .
rocked to and fro .
a tiny bottle with a liquid that looked like oil in it .
relieved .
she felt that her rent was safe .
kissed the hem of her green gown .
what she like to ask -- her son .
gave a piteous cry .
she could not take him even then .
sit in her kitchen and cry , hug her baby tighter .
sit in her kitchen and cry , hug her baby tighter .

she was no beauty .
she turned round and ran down the brae , shrieking with rage .
